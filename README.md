# Installing this module

## Local installation (not recommended)
Although a local installation is possible, we recommend an installation through docker. This is less likely to breake support and has been tested with latest updates. We are working with python 3.6.9 which can be difficult to install. 
> **Requirements**
>
> This project has been tested in Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6.9. Further package requirements are described in the
> `requirements.txt` file.
> - It is a requirement to have [Tensorflow>=1.14 installed](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) (either in gpu 
> or cpu mode). This is not listed in the `requirements.txt` as it [breaks GPU support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7166). 
> - Run `python -c 'import cv2'` to check that you installed correctly the `opencv-python` package (sometimes
> [dependencies are missed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47113029/importerror-libsm-so-6-cannot-open-shared-object-file-no-such-file-or-directo) in `pip` installations).

To start using this framework clone the repo and download the [default weights](https://share.services.ai4os.eu/index.php/s/rJQPQtBReqHAPf3/download):

```bash
# First line installs OpenCV requirement
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgl1
git clone https://github.com/lifewatch/phyto-plankton-classification
cd phyto-plankton-classification
pip install -e .
curl -o ./models/phytoplankton_vliz.tar.xz https://share.services.ai4os.eu/index.php/s/rJQPQtBReqHAPf3/download #create share link from nextcloud
cd models && tar -xf phytoplankton_vliz.tar.xz && rm phytoplankton_vliz.tar.xz
```

## Install through Docker (recommended)

### 1.1 Install docker
Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). 

### 1.2 Run docker
Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system before executing the DEEP-OC Phytoplankton Classification module using Docker containers.
So open docker, if correct, you should see a small ship (docker desktop) symbol running on the bottom right of your windows screen

### 1.3 Clone the directory
The directory is cloned so that the remote and the local directory are the same. This makes it easier to copy files inside the remote directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4os-hub/phyto-plankton-classification
cd phyto-plankton-classification
```

### 1.4 Run the Docker Container Inside the Local Folder

After Docker is installed and running, you can run the ready-to-use [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/ai4oshub/phyto-plankton-classification) to run this module. There are two options for handling images based on their storage location:

Run container and only have local access
```bash
docker run -ti -p 8888:8888 -p 5000:5000 -v "$(pwd):/srv/phyto-plankton-classification" ai4oshub/phyto-plankton-classification:latest /bin/bash
```
For MacOS:
To get the latest version of the phytoplankton module running locally as well, please use the following code:
```bash
curl --insecure -L -o "models\phytoplankton_vliz.tar.gz" https://share.services.ai4os.eu/index.php/s/rJQPQtBReqHAPf3/download
tar -xzf "/models/phytoplankton_vliz.tar.gz" "/models"
del "/models/phytoplankton_vliz.tar.gz"
```
> **Tip**: Rclone can also be configured to acces nextcloud server, follow [Tutorial](https://docs.ai4os.eu/en/latest/user/howto/train/rclone.html).


Now the environment has the right requiremens to be excecuted. 


## Open through Deepaas
Call-in on Imagine Marketplace and follow the [Tutorial](https://docs.ai4os.eu/en/latest/user/howto/train/dashboard.html). 
For more a detailed tutorial, please follow: [readme_tutorial](README_marketplace.md).

# 1. Train the phyto-plankton-classifier

You can train your own audio classifier with your custom dataset. For that you have to:

## 1. Data preprocessing

The first step to train you image classifier if to have the data correctly set up. 

### 1.1 Prepare the images

The model needs to be able to access the images. So you have to place your images in the [./data/images](/data/images) folder. If you have your data somewhere else you can use that location by setting the `image_dir` parameter in the training args. 
Please use a standard image format (like `.png` or `.jpg`). 

You can copy the images to [phyto-plankton-classification/data/images](/data/images) folder on your pc. 
If the images are on nextcloud, you can one of the next steps depending if you have rclone or not. 


### 1.2 Prepare the data splits (optional)

Next, you need add to the [./data/dataset_files](/data/dataset_files) directory the following files:

| *Mandatory files* | *Optional files*  | 
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  `classes.txt`, `train.txt` |  `val.txt`, `test.txt`, `info.txt`,`aphia_ids.txt`|

The `train.txt`, `val.txt` and `test.txt` files associate an image name (or relative path) to a label number (that has
to *start at zero*).
The `classes.txt` file translates those label numbers to label names.
The `aphia_ids.txt` file translates those the classes to their corresponding aphia_ids.
Finally the `info.txt` allows you to provide information (like number of images in the database) about each class. 

You can find examples of these files at [./data/demo-dataset_files](/data/demo-dataset_files).

If you don't want to create your own datasplit, this will be done automatically for you with a 80% train, 10% validation, and 10% test split.


## 2. Training methods

### 2.1: Train with cmd

#### 2.1.1: Adapting the yaml file
Clarify the location of the images inside the [yaml file](/etc/config.yaml) file. If not, [./data/images](/data/images) will be taken. 
Any additional parameter can also be changed here such as the type of split for training/validation/testing, batch size, etc

You can change the config file directly as shown below, or you can change it when running the api.

```bash
  images_directory:
    value: "/srv/phyto-plankton-classification/data/images"
    type: "str"
    help: >
          Base directory for images. If the path is relative, it will be appended to the package path.
```
#### 2.1.2: Running the training
After this, you can go to `/srv/phyto-plankton-classification/planktonclas#` and run `train_runfile.py`.

```bash
cd /srv/phyto-plankton-classification/planktonclas` 
python train_runfile.py
```
The new model will be saved under [phyto-plankton-classification/models](/models)

### 2.2: Train with Jupyter Notebooks (Recommended)
#### 2.2.1: Adapting the yaml file
Similar to [2.1.2: Running the training](#2.1.2:_Running_the_training),clarify the location of the images inside the [yaml file](/etc/config.yaml) file. If not, [./data/images](/data/images) will be taken. 
Any additional parameter can also be changed here such as the type of split for training/validation/testing, batch size, etc

You can change the config file directly as shown below.

```bash
  images_directory:
    value: "/srv/phyto-plankton-classification/data/images"
    type: "str"
    help: >
          Base directory for images. If the path is relative, it will be appended to the package path.
```
#### 2.2.2: Go to Notebooks

You can have more info on how to interact directly with the module (not through the DEEPaaS API) by examining the 
``./notebooks`` folder:

* [dataset exploration notebook](./notebooks/1.0-Dataset_exploration.ipynb):
  Visualize relevant statistics that will help you to modify the training args.
* [Image transformation notebook](./notebooks/1.1-Image_transformation.ipynb):
  To conform a new dataset with the training set that was used
* [Image transformation notebook](./notebooks/1.2-Image_augmentation):
  Notebook to perform image augmentation and expand the dataset.
* [Model training notebook](./notebooks/2.0-Model_training):
  Notebook to perform image augmentation and expand the dataset.
* [computing predictions notebook](./notebooks/3.0-Computing_predictions.ipynb):
  Test the classifier on a number of tasks: predict a single local image (or url), predict multiple images (or urls),
  merge the predictions of a multi-image single observation, etc.
* [predictions statistics notebook](./notebooks/3.1-Prediction_statistics.ipynb):
  Make and store the predictions of the `test.txt` file (if you provided one). Once you have done that you can visualize
  the statistics of the predictions like popular metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score), the confusion matrix, etc.

## 2.2: Train with Deepaas
### activation of the API
now run DEEPaaS:
```
deepaas-run --listen-ip 0.0.0.0
```
and open http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui (or http://0.0.0.0:5000/api#/) and look for the methods belonging to the `planktonclas` module.
Look for the ``TRAIN`` POST method. Click on 'Try it out', change whatever training args
you want and click 'Execute'. The training will be launched and you will be able to follow its status by executing the 
``TRAIN`` GET method which will also give a history of all trainings previously executed.

You can follow the training monitoring (Tensorboard) on http://0.0.0.0:6006.



# Predict the phyto-plankton-classifier
## 3. Predicting methods
### 3.1: Train with Jupyter Notebooks (Recommended)

deepaas-run --listen-ip 0.0.0.0
```
Go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui (or http://0.0.0.0:5000/api#/) and look for the `PREDICT` POST method. Click on 'Try it out', change whatever test args
you want and click 'Execute'. You can **either** supply a:

* a `image` argument with a path pointing to an image.

* a `zip` argument with an URL pointing to zipped folder with images.


## Extra information
### Predict through OSCAR:
You can follow the [Oscar Tutorial](https://docs.ai4eosc.eu/en/latest/howtos/deploy/oscar-manual.html). 
But basically go to: https://inference.cloud.ai4eosc.eu/ui/#/login or https://inference-walton.cloud.imagine-ai.eu/ui/#/login and sign in and look for the 'phyto-plankton-classifier'. You can put upload images in the phytoplankton-classifier bucket under "input" and found the results under "output".

If  you don't have an account yet then:

1) go to https://aai.egi.eu/ and login via the account you used for the
